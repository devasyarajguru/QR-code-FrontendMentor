- [Overview]: Creating a Landing Page with QR Code Component

For the frontend mentor challenge, I undertook the task of designing a landing page with a QR code component using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create an attractive  webpage that incorporates a QR code, providing a seamless user experience.

To begin, I set up the basic structure of the landing page using HTML. This included creating a main content section, Within the main content section, I allocated space for the QR code component, along with accompanying text and visuals.

Next, I utilized CSS to style the landing page and make it visually appealing. I applied appropriate fonts, colors, and spacing to ensure a harmonious design. I also implemented responsive design techniques to ensure that the page displays well on different devices and screen sizes.

The main focus of the landing page was the QR code component. To integrate this feature, I used HTML and CSS to create a container for the QR code image.

Throughout the development process, I followed best practices for HTML and CSS, ensuring clean and semantically structured code. 

In conclusion, the task involved creating a landing page with a QR code component using HTML, CSS. The end result is an aesthetically pleasing webpage that effectively incorporates a  QR code, providing a seamless and interactive experience for users.

1) Understanding the Requirements:
   Before starting the project, I thoroughly read and understood the requirements of the frontend mentor challenge. This included the specific features and components to be included on the landing page, as well as any additional instructions or constraints.

2) I started building the HTML structure of the landing page. I divided the page into logical sections, such as container ,main body and added appropriate semantic tags to each section. This ensured a well-organized and accessible structure for the page.   

3) To incorporate the QR code component, I created a container within the main content section of the landing page. Using HTML and CSS, I positioned the container appropriately and styled it to fit within the overall design

4) Once satisfied with the final result, I deployed the landing page to a hosting platform or shared it through a code repository. I then submitted the completed project as part of the frontend mentor challenge, following the specified submission guidelines.

5) By following this process, I was able to successfully create a landing page with a QR code component, meeting the requirements of the frontend mentor challenge while maintaining a structured and efficient development workflow.
